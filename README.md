# repo-amino.acid.converter

This is my first personal project. It can convert DNA or RNA sequence to its corresponding amino acid sequence, along with the lengths of the nucleotide and polypeptide chains. It also returns a seperate count of each type of amino acid in the output sequence. These outputs can be eaily copied to clipboard for further analysis. It may be used as a part of genomic data analysis pipeline. The input DNA or RNA file must be in .txt format and contain only the sequence itself. In other words, the data wrangling and cleaning must be done manually for now.
